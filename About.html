                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <div class="about-content">
                      <p>On November 6, 2006 the Health Assistant (Clinical) Programme started in Wa in the Upper West Region. 
                      The establishment of the programme by the Ministry of Health (MOH) was borne out of genuine need initiated 
                      by Regional Health Directorate with Dr. E. A. Agongo as the Regional Director of Health Services (RDHS) 
                      and Regional Coordination Council (RCC) under the tutelage of the Regional Minister, Honourable Ambrose 
                      Dery. The request for the establishment of the programme was occasioned by the dearth of clinical nurses in 
                      the health facilities of the Upper West Region (UWR). Data gathered in 2005 and projected to 2010 about the 
                      attrition rate of nurses was extremely worrisome. <br> <br>
                      Therefore, the need to bridge the gap to avert an imminent collapse of the clinical facilities 
                      where nurses are significant actors.
It is essential to place on record that, the Regional Health Directorate (RHD) of the Upper West Region (UWR) had 
advanced plans to commence the programme in February of 2006 when MOH requested the Region to wait for a more formal 
and structured mainstreaming of the institution. The UWR is probably, the pacesetter for the commencement of the 
Health Assistant (Clinical) programme currently known as Nursing Assistant (Clinical). At the start of the programme the 
school had no infrastructure of its own. It was virtually a make-shift facility; borrowed classrooms and office 
accommodation first from the Regional Health Administration, the Regional Hospital and Ghana Education Service. 
We had been in this borrowing spree until May 2014 when we found a New Home with a six-unit classroom 
block at Kperisi, courtesy the Municipal Assembly under the leadership of Honourable Nuhu Issahaku Putiaha, 
the Municipal Chief Executive. He added another six-unit classroom block later. Offices and teaching-learning 
accommodations are created out of these blocks. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has constructed a one-storey building and 
handed same to the College in January 2016. The contract documents were signed by Hon. S.K.A. Bagbin in 2011 and the 
construction works executed (2015-2016) by Hon. Alexander Segbefia, Minister of Health.  
The institution has undergone significant transformations since the inception of the first programme. <br>
<br>With the advent of the new premises and new infrastructure, an additional programme referred to as Registered General Nursing (Diploma) is in place. The programme started in August 22, 2014 and it is affiliated to Kwame Nkrumah University of Science (KNUST). The diploma degree would be awarded by the affiliated university while Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) would issue the professional certificate.
Having progressed in many ways, the Advisory Board together with the Management has found it prudent to change the name of the institution from Wa Health Assistant School to Nursing Training College, Wa.       
We have made frantic efforts to live up to expectation academically and clinically. 
We believe in collective responsibility in the move to make the college a Centre of Excellence. 
</p>
<h4><b>Vision</b></h4> <br>
<p>
  Our vision is to elevate the institution from a modest status to a State of the Art Edifice and Centre of Academic and Clinical excellence by 2024 so as to add human capital value in terms of skills and knowledge to the health service delivery in the Upper West Region and Ghana as a whole. 
  </p>
  <h4><b>Mission</b></h4> <br>
<pre><p>Using a well-motivated staff and with the contributions of stakeholder- partners, we seek to:
  <b>1.</b>Produce clinically and academically competent nurses at the end of the period of training and to ensure that
       the graduates avail their services to the citizens of Ghana following certification by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, 
  <b>2.</b>Continue to lobby for infrastructure especially hostel facilities,
  <b>3.</b>Develop the capacity of tutors
  <b>4.</b>Lobby for the engagement of critical staff
